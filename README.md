# The-Quack-Extension
My own quacking keyboard 🦆 (Chrome Extension)
# 🌦️ My-Weather-App

## 🌐 Overview
The Quack Extension is a personal project developed during my studies at Ada Tech School. I've always wanted to get a duck keyboard, but because could not afford it i've decided to create my very own quacking keyboard. As, at the same moment, i was developping a chrome extension in a group project at school, i've used these brand new knowledges to create my side project.  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 📜 JavaScript (JS)
- 🌐 HTML
- 🎨 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- MP3 quack sound 🦆 

## 🌟 Features
The primary goal of this project was to create an efficient chrome extension that replicates the sound of a duck when pressing any button on the keyboard, using the techs, stacks and knowledges about extension and manifests learned previously at school.

## 🚧 Challenges
One of the remaining challenge to overpass is to let the keyboard absle to write while the extension in ON. For Now, the extension blocks the writing.
